/**
 * Building Enhancement Documentation
 * 
 * This script documents how building heights are extracted and calculated
 * from OSM data during Planetiler processing.
 * 
 * Building height logic (applied in Planetiler profile):
 * 1. Use 'height' tag if available (in meters)
 * 2. Use 'building:levels' * 3 (assuming 3m per floor)
 * 3. Use 'building:min_level' for base height
 * 4. Default heights by building type:
 *    - residential: 8m
 *    - commercial: 15m
 *    - industrial: 12m
 *    - retail: 10m
 *    - office: 20m
 *    - default: 8m
